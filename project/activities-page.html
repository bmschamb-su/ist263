                <p>Rhode Island is definitely the best place to visit when it's summer. Being “the ocean state”, Rhode Island is filled with a number of different beaches and activities to do during the summer. Some of my personal favorite beaches are located in Narragansett. Personally, I think the town beach is great for people who are visiting, it has a snack bar, is in walking distance to shops, and has some of the best waves. If you are someone who is looking to spend an entire summer in Rhode Island, Bonnet Shores Beach Club is another personal favorite. This beach is a private little beach and is perfect for families. There is a pool, gift shop, snack bar, pit with a live band on the weekends, and even gives people the option to get a cabana or bathhouse if they want. Like I said before, this is a private beach so I recommend this place for families who are looking to spend the entire summer in Rhode Island. Some more great options for public beaches are Misquamicut Beach in Westerly, East Beach in Watch Hill, First Beach in Newport, and East Matunuck Beach in South Kingstown. </p>

        <h2>Visit Block Island</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <p>Another staple in Rhode Island is going to Block Island for a day trip. Block Island can be accessed by taking a ferry over, it is only about a 45 minute ride. Once you get to Block Island there are a number of different things to do there. One of the most popular things for tourists to do is to rent mopeds and ride around the island since everything is not within walking distance. There are different beaches that people visit while they are on the island as well, such as Ballard’s beach and Mansion Beach. Mansion Beach is a cool place to go because there is a long flight of stairs that people hike down to get to the actual beach. One of the greatest attractions on the island is the little zoo that they have. This is a great place to take kids because they have a little petting zoo area where you can feed some animals. After a long day, either sunbathing on the beach or touring around the island, there are some great restaurants and shops that people can go to before they get back on the ferry to return home.</p>

        <h2>Visit Newport</h2>

            <div class="column">
                <p>Newport is also a great place to take a day trip to. There are many different activities to do and they are all good for people of all ages. It is a great place to get out and go on walks, there is the Newport Cliff Walk which is a great scenic place to walk. It lines the ocean and it is 3.5 miles long. Along the walk there are beautiful mansions and gardens to look at. If you want to see more of the mansions there are different mansions that offer tours so that people can actually go inside and see them, for example The Breakers is one of them. If you are not interested in doing any of that you can also go to the downtown area where you will find different shops, restaurants and even an arcade. </p>
