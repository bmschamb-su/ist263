        <h2>Italian Food</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p class="solid">Whether you are looking for a classic Italian dish or some nachos and tacos, Rhode Island has you covered with an array of different restaurants to choose from. One of the most popular locations for a classic Italian dinner is Federal Hill, located in Providence. Federal Hill is filled with authentic Italian restaurants, some of my favorites include, Cassarinos, Massimos, Siena, and Angelo’s. All of these restaurants will provide you with different Italian dishes, and I can say for myself that they all have great chicken parmesan. If you are looking for a more casual place and do not want to go to a sit down restaurant, Caserta's pizza is also a hit for many Rhode Islanders. </p>

            <h2>Mexican Food</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p class="solid">If you want to get away from the Italian vibe and are looking for some Mexican food, Rhode Island also has you covered for that. One of my personal favorites is Diego’s, not only is the food here great but the location makes it even better. This restaurant is located in Newport and is right on the waterfront with indoor seating looking out at the ocean, as well as outdoor seating. If you are looking for tacos and nachos, this is definitely the place to go to. Condesa is also another great place to get Mexican food in Rhode Island, it has two locations, one located centrally in Warwick and the other is more northern Rhode Island, in Smithfield. This atmosphere in this restaurant is great and it has an array of different mexican entrees to choose from as well as some of the best guacamole in the state.

            <h2>Places to Eat on the Water</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p class="solid">Since Rhode Island is known as “the ocean state” tourists might also like to know some of the best places to eat that are located right on the water. One of the most popular places to go to is the Coast Guard House. This restaurant is located in Narragansett, and you really cannot get much closer to the ocean at this place. At the Coast Guard House you can find different types of food and great appetizers, all for a reasonable price and in a great location. Now, if you are looking for fresh seafood, Matunuck Oyster Bar is the place to go. This restaurant is also located on the water and it has some of the best seafood in Rhode Island. </p>
