    <h1>Bridget Schambers Biography</h1>
    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        I am a <strong>Public Health</strong> major with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am interested in working in a hospital setting helping with administration and management. When I am not at school I reside in East Greenwich, Rhode Island and I love going to the beach with my friends and family. I also enjoy going on runs and hikes with my dog Harper, who is a mini goldendoodle.
