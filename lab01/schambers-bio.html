<body> I am a Public Health major with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am interested in working in a hospital setting helping with administration and management. When I am not at school I reside in East Greenwich, Rhode Island and I love going to the beach with my friends and family. I also enjoy going on runs and hikes with my dog Harper, who is a mini goldendoodle. </body>
